You will be able to set all your commercial requirements and token rules into the Store token factory. Set a game for internal usage or to organize a restricted close beta (both planned). Every token factory and token will be represented in our platform through a token ID card, which will contain all token functionalities and is contextualized all over the platform.</p><p>Additionally, this is where you will set all the rules for your game lifecycle. Once done, everyone who buys from this factory will receive a token bound by these rules. Currently, our token factories are only able to create an atomic token.</p><p>What are tokens? A token is an immutable unit of your content, it follows the rules set of the emitting token factory. Which will give access to the content that it contains. Token factories have a real numeric version of your retail game, which provides you more features and more control on your side. There are different types of token factories such as Game, Demo, DLC, etc… This will help you to create, search for them. Token factory status helps you to keep track of them along their lifecycle.</p><p>The following is the lifecycle statuses of a token factory Draft, ready to publish, publish, expired (not available yet), unpublish (not available yet)</p><p>An atomic token: is a type of token that will give specific content access defined by the selected branch to a player. This is only the first type of token but we are planning to add more in the future to give you more flexibility and open new business opportunities through</p><p>Game package: is a single token that gives access to a game several different contents to a user(Example: Game with DLC on a single token).
