Updating your language pack will cause its repository version to have a different version number than your other repositories.</p><p>For these types of reasons, in Ultra, a game build is a collection of various repositories who often have different version numbers and that’s perfectly fine.</p><p>The “Assembling game builds” section in the File manager, is where you create game builds by assembling different repositories versions into a working build ready to be distributed to gamers.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="agb-1"> Different game build versions are actually made out of different repositories versions</p><p>Once you have a “game build version” you can assign it a Branch.</p><p>For example: MyGame Standard Edition promotes Game Build V3 as its Beta branch.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="agb-2"> On the left, the build V1 is promoted as master branch of My Game Standard Edition, on the right the build V2 is promoted to the master branch</p><p>In the picture above the build V1 is promoted as master branch of “My Game : Standard Edition” As soon as you promote build V2 as master branch, all gamers who had V1 installed will have their game updated to V2 automatically. Also, from here on, anyone who purchases the game will directly get V2.</p><p>In short the workflow looks like this:</p><p>Upload file update in a repository =&gt; A new repository version is automatically created =&gt; Assemble a new build selecting the new repository version =&gt; A new build version is created =&gt; Promote the new build version to a desired branch (beta or Master branch) =&gt; gamers receive update.</p><h3 id="pro-tip" tabindex="-1">Pro Tip <a class="header-anchor" href="#pro-tip" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pro Tip&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To own a game’s beta or master branch, you need to own a game token that grants you the beta or master branch of that game. The process of linking ownership of a game build’s branch to a token people can own is done by setting up a token factory in the token factory section of the GDC.</p><p>It is possible to sell games cheaper in markets with lower purchasing powers by creating a specific build that only includes the country’s language pack. For example, create a “My Game Chinese build” then assemble the core game files, DLCs and only the chinese language pack. This will ensure non chinese players won’t buy this cheaper Chinese game version because it won’t include English or other languages they need.</p><h3 id="important-to-know" tabindex="-1">Important to know <a class="header-anchor" href="#important-to-know" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Important to know&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Including a DLC repository in a build doesn’t mean the buyer of the game will receive this DLC! It only means the files contained in the DLC repository version you associated with this build are compatible with this build. In other words, the buyer will still have to separately buy the DLC to get it, and when he buys it, Ultra’s file distribution system will know what DLC repository version to download for this particular game build version.</p><p>In the future you’ll be able to “bundle” DLCs tokens with Game tokens, allowing you to sell your game containing DLCs. In the meantime, if you want gamers to get DLCs as part of the game they buy, upload DLC files in your core game files repository.</p><p>When you include a Language pack version in a build, the buyer of this build will have the ability to download it if he wants it. If you want to separately sell a language pack you need to upload the language pack in a DLC repository and sell it as a DLC.</p><h2 id="assembling-a-game-build" tabindex="-1">Assembling a Game Build <a class="header-anchor" href="#assembling-a-game-build" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Assembling a Game Build&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Before we can assemble a game build version, we first need to create one game build.</p><p>Click on Create new game build</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="agb-3"></p><ol><li>Select the OS you want your game build on (Support for MacOS and Linux coming soon)</li><li>Set the Internal Game build name.</li><li>Then select a core game file repository version</li></ol><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="agb-4"></p><p>Note: If you can’t select a core game file you made it&#39;s because you haven’t uploaded anything in it yet.</p><p>Click on create a build.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="agb-5"></p><p>Congratulations your build is now created!</p><hr>',32),m=[d];function h(u,g,c,b,y,f){return a(),t("div",null,m)}const k=e(p,[["render",h]]);export{v as __pageData,k as default};
