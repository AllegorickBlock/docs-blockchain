# Deploy Smart Contract

Once you have an `abi` and `wasm` file for a contract you are ready for deployment.

## Create a Wallet

You can create a wallet through [Ultra.io Smart Contract Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ultraio.ultra-cpp).

Using the Command Palette (F1), type `Ultra: Create Wallet`. 

You can use [EOSAuthority](https://eosauthority.com/generate_eos_private_key) to create a Private Key.

Take note of both your `private key` and `public key`. 

**You will need your public key after importing**.

- Fill out the password fields
  - This will be used to unlock your wallet 
- Fill out the private key field

Wallet will tell you the account creation was successful in the bottom-right upon completion.


## Creating a Test Network Account

You will need a test network account `on a support blockchain` to deploy a contract and test it.

::: warning

Currently we recommend the Jungle Testnet as the Ultra is still building infrastructure.
