# Block Producers

Block producers play a crucial role Antelope networks. Ultra is an Antelope based network that runs with its own protocol changes and differences. Here's an overview of what Block Producers are expected to do.

### Block Production

Block producers are responsible for creating new blocks in the Antelope blockchain.
They take turns producing blocks in a round-robin fashion, with each producer having a chance to create a block in a designated time slot.

### Transaction Validation

Block producers validate transactions and include them in the blocks they produce.
They ensure that transactions adhere to the consensus rules of the Antelope network and that they are valid.

### Network Maintenance

Block producers contribute to the overall health and security of the Antelope network.
They maintain a node that participates in the consensus algorithm and communicates with other nodes to propagate transactions and blocks across the network.

### Security Measures

Block producers implement security measures to protect the network from potential attacks.
This includes measures such as ensuring the integrity of the blocks, preventing double-spending, and safeguarding against other types of malicious activities.

### Governance Participation

In some blockchain networks, including Antelope-based ones, block producers may also be involved in the governance of the network.
They may participate in voting on protocol upgrades, changes to network parameters, and other important decisions that impact the Antelope ecosystem.

### Performance Optimization

Block producers are expected to maintain reliable and performant infrastructure to ensure the smooth operation of the blockchain.

This includes optimizing server performance, maintaining high-speed internet connections, and promptly addressing any technical issues.
