# Actions & Transactions

Actions and transactions constitute the core elements of the Ultra network. The former refers to functions invoked from deployed smart contracts, while the latter encompasses single or combined actions submitted to a Block Producer for evaluation by the chain.

In a standard Antelope-based network, transactions are processed in the order they are received, following a first-come, first-served approach.
